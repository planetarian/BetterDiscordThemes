Discord themes I've made (for BetterDiscord)

## KanColle DesDiv6 Compact
Heavily modified to be highly compact and space-efficient in as many ways as possible, this is a dark-purple-hued theme features the charming young ladies of KanColle's Destroyer Division 6. The window background is the only image asset used, and it can be easily replaced with an image of the user's choosing.
